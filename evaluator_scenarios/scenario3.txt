User: I would like to order pancakes

Chatbot: Pancakes sound delicious! Unfortunately, pancakes are not a dish that is typically found in the menus of the restaurants I have access to. 

    However, I can suggest some restaurants that might have a similar dish or a dish that you might enjoy. 

    Here are a few options:

    1. Roman Holiday - They have a variety of Italian desserts, but no pancakes.
    2. Sukhothai - They have a Mango Sticky Rice dessert, but it's not a pancake.
    3. Burger Shef - They have a variety of burgers, but no pancakes.
    4. Nippon - They have a variety of Japanese dishes, but no pancakes.
    5. Gagimarjos - They have a variety of Georgian dishes, but no pancakes.
    6. Sukhothai - They have a variety of Thai dishes, but no pancakes.

    If you're interested in trying something similar, I can suggest some alternatives. Or, if you'd like to order from one of these restaurants, I can help you with that.
