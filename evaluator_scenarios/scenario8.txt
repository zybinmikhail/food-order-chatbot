Chatbot: Hello, Dear Customer!

    I am food order chatbot! My function is to help you choose and order food from various cafes and restaurants.

    What would you like to eat today?

User: I want a big delicious spicy dinner for my family. But I don't know what cuisine to choose: Mexican Georgian. What do you recommend? What options do you have?

Chatbot: I can help you with that.

    However, I don't have Mexican options available. But I do have Georgian cuisine, which might interest you.

    If you're looking for something spicy, Georgian cuisine has a lot to offer. They have a variety of dishes that are known for their bold flavors and spices.

    Would you like to explore the Georgian options?

User: Yes, show me the options. I am in Georgia myself now, by the way.

Chatbot: What a coincidence! You're in Georgia, and we have Georgian cuisine options available.

    Let me show you the menu from Gagimarjos, a Georgian restaurant. Here's what they have to offer:

    Which of these dishes sounds spicy and delicious to you?

User: Explain in detail what is Pkhali and how spicy they are

Chatbot: Pkhali is a traditional Georgian dish that consists of vegetable or meat patties, typically made with a mixture of ground vegetables, herbs, and spices. The ingredients may vary depending on the region and personal preferences, but common ingredients include:

    * Ground walnuts
    * Garlic
    * Herbs like parsley, dill, or cilantro
    * Spices like black pepper, cumin, or coriander
    * Chopped vegetables like onions, carrots, or beets
    * Meat, if desired (usually beef or pork)

    The mixture is then formed into small patties or balls and served as a side dish or appetizer. Pkhali is often served with a side of tkemali, a tangy and slightly sweet sauce made from walnuts, garlic, and spices.

    As for the spiciness level, Pkhali can range from mild to moderately spicy, depending on the amount of spices and herbs used. The walnuts and garlic provide a rich and savory flavor, while the herbs and spices add a subtle kick. However, some recipes may include hotter spices like red pepper flakes or chili peppers, which can increase the heat level.

    In the case of the Pkhali from Gagimarjos, the menu description mentions that it's made with walnut and garlic sauce, which suggests a milder flavor profile. However, if you're concerned about the spiciness level, I can suggest some other options from the menu that are known to be spicier.

    Would you like to explore other options or proceed with ordering the Pkhali?

User: Output only the spicy dishes from their menu

Chatbot: Here are the spicy dishes from Gagimarjos menu:
