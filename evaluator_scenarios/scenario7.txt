User: I want Italian dishes with beef 

Chatbot: Italian dishes with beef sound perfect for a hearty dinner.

    Based on your preference, I would recommend the following restaurant:

    **Roman Holiday** - They have a variety of Italian dishes, including beef options like Lasagna al Forno (layers of pasta, Bolognese sauce, bechamel, and melted cheese baked to perfection).

    Which of these restaurants sounds appealing to you?

    Also, would you like to order any specific dishes from the menu?

Chatbot: 4 portions of Lasagna would be a delicious meal!

User: Nothing else, tomorrow by 12:00
