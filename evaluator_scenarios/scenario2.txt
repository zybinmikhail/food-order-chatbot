-- two dishes from the same restaurant that are on the menu

Chatbot: Hello, Dear Customer!

    I am food order chat bot! My function is to help you choose and order food from various cafes and restaurants.

    What would you like to eat today?

User:  I want to have pasta and pizza

Chatbot: Pasta and pizza sound delicious!

    Based on your preferences, I would recommend the following restaurants:

    1. **Roman Holiday** - They have a variety of pasta dishes, such as Spaghetti Carbonara and Lasagna al Forno, and also offer classic pizzas like Margherita Pizza.

    Would you like to order from Roman Holiday?

    If you'd like to explore other options, I can also suggest:

    2. **Burger Shef** - Although they specialize in burgers, they also have some pasta options, but not as extensive as Roman Holiday.

    Please let me know if you'd like to proceed with Roman Holiday or explore other options.

    Also, could you please tell me what time would you like the order to be delivered?

    **Pasta:**

    1. **Spaghetti Carbonara** - Pasta dish with egg, pancetta, pecorino cheese, and black pepper ($14.99)
    2. **Lasagna al Forno** - Layers of pasta, Bolognese sauce, bechamel, and melted cheese baked to perfection ($13.99)
