Chatbot: We have several pasta options available from different restaurants. 

    From Roman Holiday, we have:
    - Spaghetti Carbonara (pasta) ($14.99)
    - Lasagna al Forno ($13.99)
    - Gnocchi alla Sorrentina ($11.99)

    If you're interested in any of these options, I can guide you through the ordering process.

User: add 3 Lasagna al Forno, 5 Gnocchi alla Sorrentina, 2 Spaghetti Carbonara

Chatbot: You'd like to order:

    - 3 Lasagna al Forno ($13.99 x 3 = $41.97)
    - 5 Gnocchi alla Sorrentina ($11.99 x 5 = $59.95)
