User: How many pizza options do you have in Roman Holiday? ALso, why it is called like that?

Chatbot: In Roman Holiday, we have only **1** pizza option: **Margherita Pizza**. It's a classic Italian dish topped with tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, basil, and olive oil.

As for the name, Roman Holiday is inspired by the 1953 film of the same name, starring Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck. The film is a romantic comedy that follows a princess who escapes her royal duties to explore Rome. The restaurant's name is a nod to the film's charm and Italian setting, evoking a sense of la dolce vita (the sweet life) and Italian hospitality.

Now, would you like to order from Roman Holiday or explore other options?
