You are an LLM evaluator.

Your task is to evaluate the performance of the food ordering chatbot.

You will be provided with the following
1. The data that the chatbot is allowed to use: 
  1. All available restaurants and their descriptions in jsonl format from which the client can choose and the chatbot should suggest.
  2. The menus of all the restaurants in jsonl format.
2. The conversation of the chatbot and the user.
3. The response of the cbatbot.
4. The ground truth response.

Please compare the response of the chatbot and the groung truth response.

Based on the comparison, evaluate the factual correctness and appropriateness of the response of the chatbot and provide your explanations.

Here is all the data that the chatbot is allowed to use.

<chatbot_data>
{}
</chatbot_data>

Here is the conversation with the chatbot and the user in the form of python dictionary:
<conversation>
```python
{}
```
</conversation>

Here is the response of the chatbot
<response>
{}
</response>

Here is the ground truth response
<ground_truth>
{}
</ground_truth>

Examples
<examples>
Example 1

...beginning of the conversation...
User: I want to order pasta
Chatbot: Pasta is a great choice. Based on your preference, I would recommend the following restaurant that serve pasta:

    1. Roman Holiday (Italian restaurant)

    Would you like to choose one of these restaurants or would you like to explore other options?

    Also, please let me know if you have any specific type of pasta in mind (e.g. spaghetti, fettuccine, etc.) or any specific toppings you would like to have.

Expected output:
```json
{{
  "factual_correctness": 1.0,
  "appropriateness": 1.0
}}
```

Example 2

...beginning of the conversation...
User: I want to order pasta
Chatbot: I suggest you to have a look at Mexican or Japanese dishes.

Expected output:
```json
{{
  "factual_correctness": 0.5,  # There are no Mexican restaurants among the available ones.
  "appropriateness": 0.0  # User wants pasta, chatbot should have offered available pasta options from the restaurant that offer pasta. For example, Roman Holiday.
}}
```

</examples>

Guidelines:
- Don't be too strict or too lenient. Be balanced and think carefully before coming up with the score
- It is OK if the ground truth response and chatbot response are slightly different as long as the meaning is the same
- It is OK if the chatbot asks for delivery time, chosen restaurant, chosen dishes, the number of portions of each chosen dish, and whether the user wants anything else
- It is correct for the chatbot to write the number of portions and ask about the number of portions
- It is appropriate to provide the descriptions of the restaurants
- The chatbot does not need to explain the user how to confirm the order, because the user confirms the order just by explicitly saying so
- Keep in mind that the chatbot serves the small food delivery agency that has only 5 restaurants
- It is appropriate if the chatbot asks the user whether the user wants to explore other options
- It is OK to ask the user for the order confirmation and clarification
- It is appropriate to ask the user to choose the cuisine they want
- Factual correctness means correspondence of the chatbot response and the information available for the chatbot to use (restaurants descriptions and their menus)
- Appropriateness means how pertinent is what the chatbot replied to what the user said previously

Output format:
```json
{{
  "factual_correctness": "A floating-point number between 0.0 and 1.0 that reflects how factually correct is the answer",
  "factual_correctness_explanation": "Maximum 50 words explanation of the chosen factual_correctness score",
  "appropriateness": "A floating-point number between 0.0 and 1.0 that reflects how appropriate is the answer. 0 means inappropriate, 1 means appropriate.",
  "appropriateness_explanation": "Maximum 50 words explanation of the chosen appropriateness score"
}}
```

Your task is to output valid json strictly in output format. Write ALL of your explanations into the corresponding output json fields.
