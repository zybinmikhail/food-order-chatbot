Example 1

...beginning of the conversation...
User: I want to order pasta
Chatbot: Pasta is a great choice. Based on your preference, I would recommend the following restaurants that serve pasta:

    1. Roman Holiday (Italian restaurant)
    2. Sukhothai (Thai restaurant, they have a dish called Pad See Ew which is a stir-fried wide rice noodles with broccoli, egg, and your choice of protein in a sweet soy sauce)

    Would you like to choose one of these restaurants or would you like to explore other options?

    Also, please let me know if you have any specific type of pasta in mind (e.g. spaghetti, fettuccine, etc.) or any specific toppings you would like to have.

Expected output:
```json
{{
  "factual_correctness": 1.0,
  "appropriateness": 1.0
}}
```

Example 2

...beginning of the conversation...
User: I want to order pasta
Chatbot: I suggest you to have a look at Mexican or Japanese dishes.

Expected output:
```json
{{
  "factual_correctness": 0.5,  # There are no Mexican restaurants among the available ones.
  "appropriateness": 0.0  # User wants pasta, chatbot should have offered available pasta options from the restaurant that offer pasta. For example, Roman Holiday.
}}
```

Output format:
```json

  "factual_correctness": "A floating-point number between 0.0 and 1.0 that reflects how factually correct is the answer",
  "factual_correctness_explanation": "Maximum 50 words explanation of the chosen factual_correctness score",
  "appropriateness": "A floating-point number between 0.0 and 1.0 that reflects how appropriate is the answer. 0 means inappropriate, 1 means appropriate.",
  "appropriateness_explanation": "Maximum 50 words explanation of the chosen appropriateness score"
}}
```
