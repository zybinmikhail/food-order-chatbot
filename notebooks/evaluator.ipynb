      "2. **Special Request: Using Burger Shef's beef burgers to make spaghetti**: I'm afraid this is not possible. Here's why:\n",
      "\t* Burger Shef is a burger joint and doesn't have spaghetti on their menu, let alone provide beef burgers to be repurposed as spaghetti.\n",
      "\t* Roman Holiday's Spaghetti Carbonara is a traditional pasta dish made with, well, spaghetti (not beef burgers).\n",
      "\t* Our food delivery agency can't facilitate custom ingredient swaps between restaurants.\n",

      "3. **Delivery Time: 16:00**: No issue here! If we can finalize your order, I can indeed arrange for it to be delivered by **16:00**.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Option A:** Order the traditional Spaghetti Carbonara from Roman Holiday, made with actual spaghetti, for **$14.99**. We can still aim for a **16:00** delivery.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Option B:** If you'd like to explore alternative dishes that might satisfy your craving, please give me some hints (e.g., do you want something with beef, pasta, or a specific flavor profile?). I can suggest relevant restaurants and dishes from our available options.\n",

The ingredients may vary depending on the region and personal preferences, but common ingredients include:\n",
      "* Ground walnuts\n",
      "* Garlic\n",
      "* Herbs like parsley, dill, or cilantro\n",
      "* Spices like black pepper, cumin, or coriander\n",
      "* Chopped vegetables like onions, carrots, or beets\n",
      "* Meat, if desired (usually beef or pork)\n",
      "The mixture is then formed into small patties or balls and served as a side dish or appetizer. Pkhali is often served with a side of tkemali, a tangy and slightly sweet sauce made from walnuts, garlic, and spices.\n",
      "As for the spiciness level, Pkhali can range from mild to moderately spicy, depending on the amount of spices and herbs used. The walnuts and garlic provide a rich and savory flavor, while the herbs and spices add a subtle kick. However, some recipes may include hotter spices like red pepper flakes or chili peppers, which can increase the heat level.\n",
      "In the case of the Pkhali from Gagimarjos, the menu description mentions that it's made with walnut and garlic sauce, which suggests a milder flavor profile. However, if you're concerned about the spiciness level, I can suggest some other options from the menu that are known to be spicier.\n",

I'm happy to help, but I need to clarify a few things to ensure we can accommodate your request. Unfortunately, it seems like your request is a mix of possibilities and impossibilities with our food ordering system. Let me break it down for you:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **2 portions of Classic Cheeseburger from Burger Shef by 3 pm today**:\n",
      "\t* **Possible**: Yes, we can definitely process this part of the order. I'll highlight the dish details for confirmation:\n",
      "\t\t+ Restaurant: **Burger Shef**\n",
      "\t\t+ Dish: **Classic Cheeseburger**\n",
      "\t\t+ Quantity: **2 portions**\n",
      "\t\t+ Delivery Time: **By 3 pm today**\n",
      "\t* **Confirmed**\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Cheese from Nippon's Teriyaki Chicken**:\n",
      "\t* **Not Possible**: We cannot mix and match ingredients from different restaurants. Nippon's Teriyaki Chicken is a standalone dish, and its components cannot be used in Burger Shef's Classic Cheeseburger. If you'd like to order Teriyaki Chicken, I can suggest doing so as a separate order from **Nippon**.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Buns from Roman Holiday's Margherita Pizza**:\n",
      "\t* **Not Possible**: Similar to the previous point, we cannot use components from one restaurant's dish in another's. Roman Holiday's Margherita Pizza buns are part of their pizza, not available for use in Burger Shef's burgers. If you're interested in their pizza, I can help with an order from **Roman Holiday**.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Chef from Sukhothai to cook it**:\n",
      "\t* **Not Possible**: Each restaurant has its own chefs and kitchens. We cannot arrange for a chef from one restaurant (Sukhothai) to cook in another (Burger Shef). Sukhothai's chefs are available for orders placed directly with **Sukhothai**.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Pay in installment plan over 5 years**:\n",
      "\t* **Not Possible**: Our payment terms do not include installment plans, especially not over an extended period like 5 years. We require full payment at the time of ordering.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Simplified Order Confirmation**:\n",
      "Based on the possibilities, your confirmed order (if you'd like to proceed) is:\n",
      "- **Restaurant**: Burger Shef\n",
      "- **Dish**: Classic Cheeseburger\n",
      "- **Quantity**: 2 portions\n",
      "- **Delivery Time**: By 3 pm today\n",
      "- **Payment**: Full payment required at the time of ordering\n",

      "\n",
      "**Cuisine and Restaurants:**\n",
      "You've expressed interest in ordering Khachapuri and Khinkali, which are traditional Georgian dishes. We have a restaurant that serves Georgian cuisine: **Gagimarjos**. However, you've also mentioned **Burger Shef**, which is a burger joint with a completely different menu (Burgers). Unfortunately, we cannot offer Khachapuri and Khinkali from Burger Shef, as they are not on their menu.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Chef and Kitchen:**\n",
      "Regarding your request for the chef from Gagimarjos to cook at Burger Shef's kitchen, I'm afraid this is not possible. Our restaurants have their own dedicated kitchens and staff. We cannot arrange for a chef from one restaurant to cook in another restaurant's kitchen.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Order Quantities:**\n",
      "You've requested 20 portions of Khachapuri and 3 portions of Khinkali. While we can certainly try to accommodate large orders, please note that our maximum portion limit per dish is 15. If you'd like to proceed with the order from Gagimarjos, I can offer you up to 15 portions of each dish.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Delivery by Drone:**\n",
      "Regarding delivery, we appreciate your enthusiasm for innovative delivery methods! However, our food delivery agency currently uses traditional delivery methods (cars, bicycles, or walkers) to ensure food safety and quality. We do not have drone delivery capabilities at this time, nor can we guarantee avoidance of all trees in the city.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Revised Order Opportunity:**\n",
      "If you'd like to proceed with ordering from **Gagimarjos**, I can assist you with:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Up to 15 portions of Khachapuri (e.g., Adjaruli Khachapuri or Megrelian Khachapuri)\n",
      "* Up to 15 portions of Khinkali (e.g., Kalakuri Khinkali or Mtiuluri Khinkali)\n",
      "* Traditional delivery methods (estimated delivery time will be provided upon order confirmation)\n",
      "\n",
      "Please respond with one of the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Proceed with ordering from Gagimarjos** (specify dishes and quantities up to 15 per dish)\n",
      "2. **Explore other menu options from Gagimarjos** (I can provide more information on their menu)\n",

      "1. **Delivery of yesterday's order**: I'm a chatbot, and our conversation just started, so I don't have any information about an order from yesterday. Each time you interact with me, it's a new conversation. If you'd like to place an order, I'll be happy to assist you with that. However, for any issues with previous orders, I recommend contacting our customer support directly (unfortunately, I don't have contact information to share, but you can try checking the website or app you used to interact with us).\n",
      "2. **Refund for Burger Shef order from last week**: Similarly, I don't have access to past orders or the ability to process refunds. For any refund requests or concerns about previous orders, please reach out to our customer support team. They'll be better equipped to handle your inquiry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's focus on your **new order**:\n",
      "\n",
      "You've requested:\n",
      "- **3 portions of Pkhali** (available at Gagimarjos, Georgian cuisine)\n",
      "- **1 portion of Matcha Green Tea Ice Cream** (available at Nippon, Japanese cuisine)\n",
      "- **15 portions of Khinkali** (available at Gagimarjos, Georgian cuisine)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important Notes**:\n",
      "- Since you can only order from **one restaurant at a time**, I'll suggest focusing on either Nippon for the Matcha Green Tea Ice Cream or Gagimarjos for the Pkhali and Khinkali.\n",
      "- **Quantity Limit**: While you've requested 15 portions of Khinkali, our system allows up to 15 portions of any dish. However, for extremely large orders, we might need to confirm availability with the restaurant. In this case, 15 portions of Khinkali should be manageable.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommendation**:\n",
      "Given that two out of your three requested items are from Gagimarjos, I suggest ordering from **Gagimarjos (Georgian cuisine)**. This way, you can get the **3 portions of Pkhali** and **15 portions of Khinkali** in one order. Unfortunately, this means you won't be able to include the **Matcha Green Tea Ice Cream** from Nippon in this particular order. If you'd still like the ice cream, you could consider placing a separate order from Nippon.\n",

Unfortunately, our policy is to allow orders from **ONLY ONE RESTAURANT** per order. I can suggest alternatives or help you choose one restaurant that might cater to your cravings.\n",
      "2. **Quantity of Portions**:\n",
      "\t* **Roman Holiday - Chicken Parmigiana**: 100 portions. Our restaurants can provide between 1 and 15 portions of any dish. I can offer to adjust this to the maximum allowed, which is **15 portions**.\n",
      "\t* **Nippon - Teriyaki Chicken**: 20 portions. Similarly, I can adjust this to the maximum, which is **15 portions**.\n",
      "3. **Delivery Time**:\n",
      "\t* **\"When the clocks strike 13\"**: Clocks typically strike up to 12, then the cycle repeats. I assume you meant either a specific time (e.g., 1 PM, which is 13:00 in 24-hour format) or as soon as possible. Please clarify your preferred delivery time within the next hour, by a specific time today, or by a specific time tomorrow.\n",
      "4. **Payment Method**:\n",
      "\t* **\"Pay with my smile\"**: Unfortunately, smiles, as wonderful as they are, aren't a viable payment method for us. We accept standard payment methods (e.g., credit/debit cards, online payment services). I can guide you through the available payment options once your order is finalized.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Next Steps**:\n",
      "To proceed, please respond with the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Choose One Restaurant**:\n",
      "\t* Do you prefer **Roman Holiday** or **Nippon** for your entire order?\n",
      "2. **Confirm Adjusted Quantities**:\n",
      "\t* If choosing one restaurant, you can select up to 15 portions of each dish available in that restaurant's menu.\n",
      "3. **Specify Delivery Time**:\n",
      "\t* Within the next hour, by a specific time today, or by a specific time tomorrow?\n",
      "4. **Acknowledge Payment Method**:\n",
      "\t* You'll need to select a standard payment method once we finalize the order details.\n",

I'd be happy to help, but I need to clarify a few things to ensure we can accommodate your request within our capabilities. Here's a breakdown of your request with my responses:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **4 portions of Chicken Pad See Ew**: This dish is available at **Sukhothai** (Thai cuisine).\n",
      "2. **Sauce from the Panang Curry**: Panang Curry is also a dish at **Sukhothai**. We can suggest modifying the Chicken Pad See Ew with the Panang Curry sauce, but please note this is a custom request, and we'll need to confirm with the restaurant if it's feasible.\n",
      "3. **Noodles from the Pad Thai**: Another dish at **Sukhothai**. We can ask if they can use the Pad Thai noodles for your Chicken Pad See Ew, but again, this is a custom request subject to the restaurant's approval.\n",
      "4. **Chicken cooked by the chef from the Roman Holiday restaurant**: Unfortunately, this is not possible. Each restaurant has its own chefs and kitchens. If you order from **Sukhothai**, their chefs will prepare your meal.\n",
      "5. **Pickup from the Burger Shef location in a different city tomorrow at 12:00**: \n",
      "   - **Different City**: We currently don't support inter-city orders. You can only order from restaurants within the same city as our service.\n",
      "   - **Pickup from Burger Shef for a Sukhothai order**: Orders must be picked up from the restaurant where the food is prepared. If you order from **Sukhothai**, you'll need to pick it up from **Sukhothai's location**.\n",
      "   - **Tomorrow at 12:00**: We can accommodate specific pickup times, but please confirm if tomorrow at 12:00 works for **Sukhothai**. Our standard delivery/pickup window is within the next hour or by a specific time today or tomorrow.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Revised Approach**:\n",
      "Given the constraints, here's a revised path forward:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Restaurant**: Sukhothai (since all base dishes are from this restaurant)\n",
      "- **Order**:\n",
      "  - 4 portions of Chicken Pad See Ew\n",
      "  - **Custom Requests** (subject to restaurant approval):\n",
      "    - Use Panang Curry sauce instead of the standard sauce\n",
      "    - Use noodles from Pad Thai for the Chicken Pad See Ew\n",
      "- **Pickup Details**:\n",
      "  - **Location**: Sukhothai's location (not Burger Shef)\n",
      "  - **Time**: Please choose a time for tomorrow (we'll confirm if it works with the restaurant)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Your Next Steps**:\n",

      "1. **Quantity: 100 portions of Pad See Ew** - I can definitely check if this is possible. According to our menu, Pad See Ew is available at **Sukhothai** (our Thai restaurant). However, our standard policy is to limit orders to a maximum of 15 portions per dish. I can inquire about a bulk order, but I'm not sure if 100 portions can be accommodated. Let me suggest an alternative: would you like to order up to 15 portions of Pad See Ew, and perhaps add other dishes to your order?\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Free Pizza** - Unfortunately, we don't have a promotion that includes a free pizza with an order of Pad See Ew. Our restaurants have separate menus, and pizzas are only available at **Roman Holiday** (our Italian restaurant). If you'd like to order a pizza, I can certainly help you with that, but it would be a separate item on your bill.\n",
      "\n",

      "\t* Our standard policy is that all sales are final. However, if there's an issue with your order (e.g., incorrect dish, missing item), please contact us, and we'll do our best to resolve the problem. Unfortunately, refunds based on personal taste preferences are not typically accommodated.\n",
      "3. **Discounts for Orders over $100**:\n",
      "\t* Currently, we don't have any discounts specifically for orders exceeding $100. However, I can suggest combining dishes to meet your cravings while staying within your budget. If promotions become available, we'll be sure to notify our customers.\n",
      "4. **Swapping Dishes between Restaurants**:\n",
      "\t* **This is not possible**. Our system allows ordering from **only one restaurant per order**. You can either order from Roman Holiday (and choose dishes like Gnocchi alla Sorrentina) or from Burger Shef (with its unique burger offerings), but not mix dishes from both in a single order.\n",

      "2. **Would you like me to suggest restaurants** based on your preferences?\n",

      "\t* **Important Note**: As per our main instructions, I don't need (nor can I accept) your friend's address via email or any other means. For simplicity, we assume the order will be delivered to **your location** (no address required from you). If you need to deliver to a different location, please arrange for the recipient to receive the order at **your end**.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Payment Method (Bitcoin)**:\n",
      "\t* **Polite Decline**: Unfortunately, our food delivery agency currently only accepts **traditional payment methods** (e.g., credit/debit cards, cash, etc.). We do not support cryptocurrency payments like Bitcoin at this time.\n",
