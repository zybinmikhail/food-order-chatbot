      "\n",
      "**Components:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Main Ingredient:** Pkhali can be made with various main ingredients, which can be:\n",
      "\t* **Vegetables:** Beetroot, cabbage, carrots, spinach, or a combination of these.\n",
      "\t* **Meat:** Beef, chicken, or turkey (though less traditional).\n",
      "2. **Walnut Paste:** A crucial component, adding richness and depth to the dish. The walnuts are typically ground into a fine paste.\n",
      "3. **Spices and Herbs:**\n",
      "\t* **Garlic:** Minced garlic is usually added for flavor.\n",
      "\t* **Cilantro (Coriander):** Fresh or dried cilantro leaves contribute to the aromatic flavor.\n",
      "\t* **Dill:** Fresh dill weed might be added for extra freshness.\n",
      "\t* **Spices:** Salt, black pepper, and occasionally, a pinch of cayenne pepper or red pepper flakes (for some heat).\n",
      "4. **Binding Agent:** Sometimes, a small amount of vinegar or lemon juice is used to balance the flavors and help bind the mixture.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Spice Level (Heat):**\n",
      "The spice level of Pkhali can vary depending on the recipe and personal preferences. Generally:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Mild:** Most traditional Pkhali recipes have a mild flavor profile, with a focus on the freshness of the herbs and the earthiness of the walnuts.\n",
      "* **Moderately Spicy:** Some recipes might include a small amount of cayenne pepper or red pepper flakes, adding a subtle kick (about 2-3 out of 10 in terms of heat).\n",
      "* **Spicy (Optional):** If you specifically request a spicier version, additional hot peppers or more substantial amounts of cayenne pepper can be added, increasing the heat level (up to 6-7 out of 10).\n",
      "\n",
      "**In the Context of Your Order:**\n",
      "Since you mentioned you're looking for a spicy dinner, if you choose the Pkhali from Gagimarjos, I can:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Confirm the spice level:** I'll check with the kitchen to see if they can adjust the spice level to your liking.\n",
      "2. **Recommend pairing with a spicier dish:** If you'd like to combine Pkhali with another, spicier option from the Gagimarjos menu (like Lobio, which is described as \"very spicy\"), I can guide you through that.\n",
